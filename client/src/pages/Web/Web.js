                <p>My favorite part of working with web and software is the limitless opportunities to solve problems.</p>

                <p>I've recently refactored my online portfolio a single page ReactJS app. Building a front-end with React comes with a ton of advantages.</p>

                                <p>Culture Stack is a social media app that allows users to share their creative works and get feedback from other artists in their industry. We have created a platform for photographers to upload, categorize, and describe any challenges they are having with a particular technique or process.</p>
                                <p>This app was built on a MERN Stack - using <strong>MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS</strong>. The app is now hosted on Heroku, which does not allow local file storage. because of this, I've set up cloud storage via <strong>Amazon Web Services S3</strong> for all user uploaded content.</p>

                                <p>MeHungry is a small project that I worked on with a partner in late 2017. The idea was to build an app that suggests local restaraunts, caf√©s, and bars to the user based on their current mood and preferences. JJ worked on the front-end design while I worked on the API calls and javascript logic.</p>
                                <p>As silly as the idea seems, I learned a ton about the <strong>Google Maps and Google Places API</strong>, as well as javascript callbacks. We used <strong>Firebase</strong> to store previous seach parameters, which allows the user to recall their previous search results the next time they visit the page.</p>
